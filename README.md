~~I'm not sure if Mojang even still hosts Minecraft classic servers. If they do, the heartbeat has probably changed so this server probably won't work anymore. Just to look at.~~ Needs to be updated to https

Since this was linked on wiki.vg:

  -Feel free to modify/use/distribute/whatever this software any way you want, I'm not licensing it.
  
  -To assemble this you need flat assembler which can be downloaded [here](http://flatassembler.net/download.php). 
  
  -If anyone wants to update this so that it works on minecraft.net again (needs to be updated to https) send a pull request and I'll add it.
